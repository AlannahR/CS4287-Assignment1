# CS4287-Assignment1
CS4287 Assignment 1 - MLP

1. Objectives
 To build a “traditional” Machine Learning (ML) pipeline using a “traditional” MuiltLayer
Perceptron (MLP) for classification.

 Explore the impact of varying hyperparameter(s).


2. Submission
Submit a pdf describing
1. The Data Set
a. Visualisation of some of the key attributes is necessary for a top grade
2. Any pre-processing such as normalisation applied to the data
3. The network structure and other hyperparameters
4. The Cost / Loss / Error / Objective function
5. The optimiser
6. Cross Fold Validation
7. Results – accuracy and/or precision and/or recall
a. Include graph(s) if opting for a top grade.
8. Evaluation of the results
9. Impact of varying a hyperparameter(s)


Submit a Jupyter notebook with the code where:
 The book is named CS4287-Prj1-ID1-ID2

o Where ID1 and ID2 are the student id numbers of the team members

 The first line in the book is a comment with names and ID numbers of the team members


 The second line in the book should be a comment stating if the code executes to the end without
an error.

 The third line in the book should be a comment with a link to the original source where you
opted to reuse an existing implementation.

 Every critical line of code MUST be commented by YOU. To demonstrate a deep
understanding of that code.
